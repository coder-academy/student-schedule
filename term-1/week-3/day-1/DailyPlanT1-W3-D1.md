### Monday's Challenge

## Create an app: e.g. Bank account management

Problem to solve: <br>
A bank needs to keep track of customers and create accounts for each customer.<br>
They have requested an app that a bank teller can use.<br>
You need to create a terminal application (program that runs in the terminal/command line).

### Action — this program allows the user to:
1. add customer,
2. remove customer,
3. edit customer,
4. make a deposit,
5. make a withdrawal,
6. display customer details.

The customer details are saved to a file.

## User Stories

1. As a bank teller, I want to add customer details, so that they become an on-going customer.
2. As a bank teller, I want to edit customer details, so that I can keep up to date with their changing circumstances.
3. As a bank teller, I want to make deposits, so that our customers can keep their money with us.
4. As a bank teller, I want to make withdrawals, so that our customers can make use of their money whenever they like.
5. As a bank teller, I want to look up customer details, so I can inform them of their balance.

### Customer data:
1. Customer ID
1. Name
2. Address
3. Phone number
4. Email Address
5. Bank balance

### Use OOP to create this application

1. Menu
2. Files
