Term 1 Project #1

#### Add a favicon to your website.

Add this to your `<head>`, and put your `favicon.ico` file at the top of your site (next to your index.html).
```
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
```

Browsers will automatically look for a favicon at `www.example.com/favicon.ico`, so thatâ€™s why it must be placed there.
