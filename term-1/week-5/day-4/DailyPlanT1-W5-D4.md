#### Week 5 Thursday Day 4

---

### Thursday's Subject
Deploying your portfolio to GitHub.

### Thursday's Challenge

Deploy your website to GitHub Pages. https://pages.github.com/

Use GitHub Desktop for a nice UI, or if you want to try something more advanced, use the `git` command line tool.

Note that you can continually push updates to your website — it’s not locked in and final, so you can still make changes before your day of presentation.
